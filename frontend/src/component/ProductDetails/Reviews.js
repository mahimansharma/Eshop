                                I basically bought this phone as i have broken my realme 3 pro and needed a reliable phone which provide me with best after sales service. Chinese phones may provide best value for money but they aren't as reliable as branded phones. Once u broke ur Chinese phone u wil keep on pondering where to service it as u wont find good service center for Chinese phones. Moreover the life span of chinese phones are also not that great as with times they tend to slow down. I could have have got iQoo3 in 31k which has SD865 and with so many features but i dint buy i went for S10 lite coz i want reliability. Everythng else u knw.
                                camera is good. After frst update camera is improved
                                screen is brilliant no complain
                                Finger lock is bit slow needs improvement
                                faceunlock too
                                battery is good but optimization required via software update
                                performance is makhkhan as i play pubg and it runs super smooth
                                u need to put screen protector specially matte one as my finger stick while playing pubg
                                Typing on this phone is lovable. The click sound and haptic feedback is awesome. This only happens in brand not in chinese.
                                Oneplus 8 wud be a good option but u have to compromise with 4300mAh battery whereas s10 lite have 4510 mAh. Oneplus has 90 htz refresh rate which consume more charge so u wil have to charge phone at the end of the day if u r a heavy user.
                                Moreover i got this phone at 38999 so u need to payout little bit more for oneplus 8 but still it's chinese which i dont prefer.
                                Please like my review if its helpful to u as i have written the practical experience which anyone needed.
